abstract="This work introduces the Trigger Arc Travelling Salesman Problem (TATSP), a variant of the classical TSP that models dynamic arc costs influenced by the solution's path. It is presented a real-world application that can be modelled through the TATSP, aiming to optimise operations in warehouses with compactable storage systems. An Integer Linear Programming model (ILP) is described and implemented. Finally, the experimental results obtained from a set of generated instances are discussed.",
